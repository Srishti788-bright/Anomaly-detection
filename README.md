# Anomaly-detection
In this project, I built a machine learning model capable of identifying abnormal patterns in real-world data. I worked on data preprocessing, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, training the model, and evaluating performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall & F1-score.
Dataset: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION.
This project helped me gain deeper insights into how AI can support critical applications such as fraud detection.
